GAME_INTRO_TEXT_1 = """He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, 
man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. 
They were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, 
and those who were with him in the ark. And the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days.
Genesis 7:23,24"""


GAME_INTRO_TEXT_2 = """AD 2063. The planet has been colonised. 
Three human bases, Shem, Ham and Japheth, have been placed around the planet's equatorial region. 

Regular launches resupply the ever expanding settlements. Life on the planet is peacful; 
Scientists, technicians, mission specialists, medics and others regularly make the hazadous journey
to and from the plant. 

There is political pressure from home to start civilian colonisation within 
the next year. The regular pattern of launches is expanded - at the risk of safety procedures 
being circumvented and shortcuts being taken.

Now the unthinkable has happened. The seventeenth launch of the Rubicon transport rocket from the 
planet surface resulted in disaster with the spaceship breaking up before escaping into orbit.
Many lives have been lost.

There is, however, some hope for the small number of men and women who made it to the survival 
pods, but they are scattered around the planet surface and time is running out for those 
poor souls waiting for rescue.

Good luck - lives depend on you.
